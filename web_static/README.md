Static web refers to web pages or websites that are delivered to the user's web browser exactly as they were created, without any dynamic content or interactivity. These websites typically consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are stored on a web server and served to the user upon request.

Static websites are commonly used for simple web pages or sites that don't require frequent updates or real-time interactions. They are often faster to load because the web server can directly deliver the pre-built files to the user's browser without any additional processing.

Static websites are created by building the web pages using HTML, adding styling with CSS, and enhancing functionality with JavaScript. Once the website is built, the files are uploaded to a web server, and when a user requests a page, the server simply sends the pre-existing file to the user's browser.

Static websites have some advantages over dynamic websites. They are generally easier to develop and maintain since they don't require complex server-side programming or database integration. They are also more secure because there is no server-side code that can be exploited.

However, static websites have limitations in terms of interactivity and real-time content. They cannot easily handle user input, process forms, or provide personalized experiences. To overcome these limitations, dynamic websites are used, which generate content on the server side based on user interactions or data from databases.

Overall, static websites are a straightforward and efficient way to deliver information or showcase content that doesn't require frequent updates or advanced functionality.
